I am professor by special appointment of Social Divisions between Groups in the
[Department of Sociology at the University of
Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/gmw/sociology/), associate professor in the
[Sociology Department of Radboud University
Nijmegen](https://www.ru.nl/sociology/) and since February 2025 also vice dean
of education of the [Faculty of Social Sciences at Radboud
University](https://www.ru.nl/en/about-us/organisation/faculties/social-sciences).
Before this I was, for quite some years, the program director of the [Research
Master Social and Cultural
Science](https://www.ru.nl/courseguides/socsci/research-master/social-cultural-science/)
of Radboud University.  
In my **research** I focus on social divisions between
groups; the interplay of segregation, inequality and polarization. Lately, I
have been thinking about how to start a research project on 'Who joins the
debate?' (for lack of a better name). Who, when and why do we decide to start,
join, or avoid a contested discussion? For example, within our own university
walls, when and why do academics decide to (not) express their professional and
personal opinions regarding DEI policies, genAI, the budget cuts, or the
genocidal violence going on in Gaza? One hypothesis I would like to test is that
people may not join political debates because they perceive the debate to be
more polarized than it is in reality.  
When **teaching** students, my aim is to
feed their scientific curiosity and to help them ask relevant questions. For
this, I try to hammer to point home that imho the best questions arise out of a
combination of theoretical knowledge, methodological skills and hands-on
experience with different type of data (collection). And yes I know that this
seems to contradict the hypothetico-deductive approach but it doesn't.  
I see it as my task as **vice dean** to help the educational directors in maintaining the
high quality of their respective educational programmes. While the current budget cuts
present many challenges, they also bring new opportunities. There is momentum for
change, for example, to foster greater interdisciplinary
collaboration within and between faculties and to regain focus on our core tasks: providing high quality education and research.
  
  On this site you will find pdfs of my papers,
some of my  R-tutorials (on diagonal reference models, marginal effects,
micro-macro models) and an introduction to [conceptual
models](https://www.jochemtolsma.nl/conceptual-models/). Conceptual models may
help you in organizing your thought process and may help a lay audience in
understanding your research ideas. You can still find older versions of my
course Social Networks Analysis for social scientists
[here](https://www.jochemtolsma.nl/courses/) but I strongly recommend you to
check out [SNASS](https://www.jtolsma.nl/SNASS/) to see if I and [Bas
Hofstra](https://www.bashofstra.com/) were already able to update the material.
With that, thanks for reading and enjoy!
