I am professor by special appointment of Social Divisions between Groups in the
[Department of Sociology at the University of
Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/gmw/sociology/), associate professor in the
[Sociology Department of Radboud University
Nijmegen](https://www.ru.nl/sociology/) and since February 2025 also vice dean
of education of the [Faculty of Social Sciences at Radboud
University](https://www.ru.nl/en/about-us/organisation/faculties/social-sciences).
Before this I was, for quite some years, the program director of the [Research
Master Social and Cultural
Science](https://www.ru.nl/en/education/masters/social-and-cultural-science-comparative-research-on-societies-research)
of Radboud University.  

In my **research** I focus on social divisions between
groups; the interplay of segregation, inequality and polarization. 
I am also interested in how people form relations 
with others (e.g., friendships, helping, sporting together) and more precisely 
in the extent to which people coordinate these
'selection' decisions. For this I am also developing and exploring new social networks methods
suited to test hypotheses on coordinated tie-formation (see [RsienaTwostep](https://jochemtolsma.github.io/RsienaTwoStep/index.html)).

When **teaching** students, my aim is to
feed their scientific curiosity and to help them ask questions that are both
scientific innovative *and* societally relevant. 

I see it as my task as **vice dean** to help my colleagues in maintaining the
high quality of our educational programmes and to foster greater (interdisciplinary) collaboration.
  
  On this site you will find pdfs of my papers,
some of my  R-tutorials (marginal effects,
micro-macro models) and an introduction to [conceptual
models](https://www.jochemtolsma.nl/conceptual-models/). Conceptual models may
help you in organizing your thought process and may help a lay audience in
understanding your research ideas. You can still find older versions of my
course Social Networks Analysis for social scientists
[here](https://www.jochemtolsma.nl/courses/) but I strongly recommend you to
check out [SNASS](https://www.jtolsma.nl/SNASS/) to see if I and [Bas
Hofstra](https://www.bashofstra.com/) were already able to update the material.

With that, thanks for reading and enjoy!

<p>More of me:</p>
<button class="collapsible">More research</button>
<div class="content">
  <p> <br> Lately, I
have been thinking about how to start a research project on 'Who joins the
debate?' (for lack of a better name). Who, when and why do we decide to start,
join, or avoid a contested discussion? For example, within our own university
walls, when and why do academics decide to (not) express their professional and
personal opinions regarding DEI policies, genAI, the budget cuts, or the
genocidal violence going on in Gaza? One hypothesis I would like to test is that
people may not join political debates because they perceive the debate to be
more polarized than it is in reality. I also would like to understand how and 
when coordination (e.g. "Let us both speak up together against ... .") may lead 
to more or less representative debates. </p>
</div>
<br>
<button class="collapsible">More teaching</button>
<div class="content">
  <p> <br> I try to hammer to point home that imho the best questions 
  - that combine scientific innovation with societal relevance - arise out of a
combination of theoretical knowledge, methodological skills and hands-on
experience with different type of data (collection). And yes I know that this
seems to contradict the hypothetico-deductive approach but it doesn't. 
While many of the students I teach want to 'save the world' I am struggling 
with the fact to so many of them are quite privileged and have not experienced themselves 
(or not even seem to know persons who have experienced) discrimination, poverty, etc. 
Don't get me wrong, I am definitely not saying that lived experience is essential for insight into social phenomena 
like inequality and segregation but it sure as hell does help in understanding 
what we are talking about in our - at times - abstract and somewhat detached scientific papers.

  While the current budget cuts
present many challenges, they also bring new opportunities. There is momentum for
change, for example, to foster greater interdisciplinary
collaboration within and between faculties and to regain focus on our core tasks: 
providing high quality education and research. If it is up to me: less bureaucracy (duh); 
less (graded) exams (and more time for teaching); 
less unscalable teaching innovation experiments 
(more adoption of effective innovative teaching methods and more teacher autonomy); less coaching by teachers 
(more attention for diverse student needs in University Teaching Qualification tracks).
