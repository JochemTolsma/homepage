Jochem Tolsma is professor by special appointment of Social Divisions between Groups in the [Department of Sociology at the University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/gmw/sociology/), associate professor in the [Sociology Department of Radboud University Nijmegen](https://www.ru.nl/sociology/) and the program director of the [Research Master Social and Cultural Science](https://www.ru.nl/courseguides/socsci/research-master/social-cultural-science/) of Radboud University.
In his research he focuses on social divisions between groups; the interplay of segregation, inequality and polarization. His particular areas of interest are the causes and consequences of segregation in neighborhoods, schools and friendship networks.

On this site you you will find some of my  R-tutorials (on diagonal reference models, marginal effects, micro-macro models) and an introduction to [conceptual models](https://www.jochemtolsma.nl/conceptual-models/). Conceptual models may help you in organizing your thought process and may help a lay audience in understanding your research ideas. You can still find older versions of my course Social Networks Analysis for social scientists [here](https://www.jochemtolsma.nl/courses/) but I strongly recommend you to check out [SNASS](https://www.jtolsma.nl/SNASS/) to see if I and [Bas Hofstra](https://www.bashofstra.com/) were already able to update the material.  

With that, thanks for reading and enjoy!
