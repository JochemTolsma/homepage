# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio:  Dr. Niels Spierings [(homepage)](https://www.ru.nl/english/people/spierings-c/) works on issues of inequality and participation, with particular foci on gender, politics, and islam. On these topics academia, media and society are often flooded with simplism and overgeneralizations. He hopes his research contributes to more accurate knowledge, understanding and some empathy.
