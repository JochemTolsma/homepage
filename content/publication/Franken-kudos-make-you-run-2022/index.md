title: 'Kudos make you run!'
subtitle: 'How runners influence each other on the online social network Strava'
summary: 'We used Strava’s big data to investigate influence dynamics among athletes in online social networks. We constructed a longitudinal dataset of complete networks and behavior over 11 periods with a one-month time window for five different Strava clubs with a total of 329 members. We tested our hypotheses using [RSiena](https://github.com/snlab-nl/rsiena). We found that receiving kudos makes you run more and more often and that athletes tended to adjust their running behavior to that of their kudos-friends. But the story is way more nuanced, so check out the complete paper!  
Together with the paper we constructed a detailed replication [repository/website](https://robfranken.github.io/Strava/). Long live Open Science!.'
