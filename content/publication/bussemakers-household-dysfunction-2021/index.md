subtitle: ''
summary: 'Household dysfunction after age 5 harms children’s behavioural problems but children’s verbal ability is not affected by household dysfunction. A lack of financial resources is an important predictor of household dysfunction but the consequences of household dysfunction are similar for children of low- and high-income households.'
