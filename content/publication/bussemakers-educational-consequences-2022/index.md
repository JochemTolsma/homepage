title: 'Variation in the educational consequences of parental death and divorce: The role of family and country characteristics'
subtitle: ''
summary: 'We investigated how family and national contexts moderate the educational consequences of these adverse events. At the family level, we studied whether the educational consequences of parental death and divorce are larger for children of higher-educated parents. At the national level, we investigated the buffering role of welfare benefits as well as the amplifying impact of a selective educational system and the divorce rate. Moreover, we examined the interplay between family and country contexts.'
