title: 'Similarity and differences in age, gender, ethnicity, and education as explanatory factors of tie loss in the core discussion network'
summary: 'Individuals are more likely to interact with people who are similar in terms of socio-demographics and values than dissimilar people, which is often explained by a focus on selection effects. Yet, tie loss of dissimilar ties might also cause network homogeneity. Unfortunately, within the literature, there is a relative dearth of knowledge on the relationship between (dis)similarity and tie loss. Hence, we address this gap by theorizing and testing the relation between (dis)similarity and tie loss in the core discussion network (CDN) of Dutch citizens, also considering how ties are embedded in the CDN.  

Together with the paper we constructed a detailed replication [repository/website](https://thijmenjeroense.github.io/cdn-tie-loss-similarity/). Long live Open Science!'
