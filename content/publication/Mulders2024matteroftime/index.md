title: 'A matter of time? Gender and ethnic inequality in the academic publishing careers of Dutch Ph.D.s'
summary: 'Women and ethnic minorities underpopulate influential academic positions. 
Using a novel data set of a nearly complete population of doctorates (N = 95,130) 
from Dutch universities across all academic fields between 1990 and 2021, we extend descriptions on gender and ethnic inequality in academic publication careers.
We do not observe a trend towards more equality in academic publishing careers.

abstract: 'Women and ethnic minorities underpopulate influential academic positions, even though these groups are increasingly represented at the doctorate level. Does this imply that gender and ethnic gaps in academic careers are closing? Prior studies on gender inequality in academia predominantly focus on single academic fields or restricted time periods. Longitudinal descriptions of ethnic inequality are even more rare. Using a novel data set of a nearly complete population of doctorates (N = 95,130) from Dutch universities across all academic fields between 1990 and 2021, and their publications, we extend descriptions on gender and ethnic inequality in academic publication careers in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we assess trends in inequality over approximately 30 years without focusing on established academics. We find that while women are as likely as men to start an academic publishing career after obtaining a doctorate, their careers are shorter. Ethnic minority scholars are less likely to start an academic career after their doctorate, and when they do, they stop sooner than ethnic majority researchers. We do not observe a trend towards more equality in academic publishing careers. In conclusion, efforts to increase diversity in Dutch academia have not yet paid off, and gender and ethnic parity are likely not just a matter of time.
